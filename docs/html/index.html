This is the primary language we use to write web pages. It's called a "markup" language because it marks-up otherwise plain text with additional information about the document's structure (headings, paragraphs, headers, footers, asides, etc.). And the "HyperText" part just means that it's a markup language for documents that link to each other.</p><p>HTML's syntax is very simple. One of the reasons it has become so popular is that it generally takes someone only a few minutes to learn it. If you already know HTML, you can skim this as a refresher. If you've never written HTML from scratch, this tutorial will teach you how to do it.</p><h2 id="sechtmlisjusttext">HTML is Just Text</h2><p>HTML files are just plain text files, so you can edit them in any text editor, but there are <a href="../client-side-setup/#seccodeediting">several editors that are optimized for web development</a>. I recommend using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (vscode) for this tutorial. It's free, available on all platforms, and has all of the features you need already built-in.</p><p>To start this tutorial, create a folder somewhere in your computer. Choose the <code>File</code> menu in vscode, and then choose <code>Open...</code>. Find the folder you created, select the folder, and choose the <code>Open</code> button.</p><p>From the <code>File</code> menu again, choose <code>New File</code>, and save that new file with the name <code>index.html</code> inside the folder you opened. By giving it the file extension <code>.html</code> you have told vscode that this is an HTML file, so it will give you the correct syntax coloring and features.</p><p>The name <code>index.html</code> is also special on the web. When a web browser asks a web server for a path that points to a folder, the web server will look for a file named <code>index.html</code> and return it to the browser if it exists. This is considered the "home page" for the folder.</p><h2 id="sechtmldocumentsstartwithadoctypedeclaration">HTML Documents Start with a Doctype Declaration</h2><p>All HTML files start with a document type declaration, commonly referred to as the "doctype." The HTML version 5 document type declaration is really simple. Enter this as the first line of your HTML file:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></span></code></pre><p>That tells any program that reads this file to interpret the contents as HTML version 5 syntax. As the version number implies, <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/past.html">there have been several versions of HTML</a> already, and not all of them used the exact same syntax. Thankfully for you, HTML5 is now the current standard and it's syntax is simple and straightforward.</p><h2 id="sechtmlisatreeofelements">HTML is a Tree of Elements</h2><p>The rest of an HTML document is a simple tree of <strong>elements</strong>. If you've taken a computer science course, you should already know what a tree data structure is, but if you haven't (or if you forgot), a tree is a very common data structure that looks like this:</p><p><img src="img/tree.png" alt="tree data structure"></p><p>Each of those blue rectangles is known as a <strong>node</strong>. Each node has a <strong>parent node</strong>, except for the one at the top of the tree, which is known as the <strong>root node</strong>. Each node may have one or more <strong>child nodes</strong>, and those children can have children of their own (and so on, and so on). A node with no children is known as a <strong>leaf node</strong>.</p><p>These tree data structures are used all of the place in computer software. For example, the way your computer stores and organizes files is a tree structure: files exist within folders, which can exist within other folders, and so on, and so on. Files are leaf nodes and the folder that has no parent folder (e.g., the <code>c:</code> drive on Windows or the <code>/</code> root folder on a Unix system) is a root note.</p><h2 id="sechtmlsyntax">HTML Syntax</h2><p>The nodes in an HTML document tree are known as <strong>elements</strong>. An element has the following syntax:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>element-name</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>...some content...<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>element-name</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><h3 id="secstartandendtags">Start and End Tags</h3><p>An element is composed of a <strong>start tag</strong> and <strong>end tag</strong> and some content in between. The start tag is this bit:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>element-name</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><p>The <code>element-name</code> part will be whatever the element's name is: for example, <code>html</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>h1</code>, <code>p</code>. There are <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp">lots of elements</a> defined in HTML, and each communicates something about the content inside of the element.</p><p>The end tag looks just like the start tag, except it has a forward-slash just after the less-than sign:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>element-name</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><p>That marks the end of the element. What goes in between is the element's <strong>content</strong>, which can be plain text, other elements, or a mixture of both. For example, a paragraph element might have some text as well as other elements to emphasize specific words within the paragraph:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>I really want to <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>em</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>emphasize<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>em</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span> that last point!<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><blockquote><p>I really want to <em>emphasize</em> that last point!</p></blockquote><p>The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element is used for content that is emphasized, and it can be nested inside lots of other elements. Although browsers typically render emphasized text in italics, you shouldn't think of that element as "the italics tag." Instead, think of it as a tag that tells the program reading this page that the text inside is emphasized. We can use CSS to format that emphasized text any way we want, so we use elements like <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> to denote the <em>function</em> that text plays.</p><h3 id="secattributes">Attributes</h3><p>The start tag of an element may also contain one or more <strong>attributes</strong>, which are used to specify options, provide additional information, or add subtler shades of meaning to an element. Attributes go inside the start tag, and look like this:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span> <span class="token attr-name">lang</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>en<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">class</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>alert<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>...some content...<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><p>The syntax for attributes is a name, followed by an equal sign, followed by a value in double-quotes. If there are multiple attributes, they are separated by spaces. The HTML standard defines several <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_standardattributes.asp">global attributes</a> that can be used on any element, and many elements also define their own attributes that are particular to that element. The <code>lang</code> attribute shown in the previous example is a global one used to indicate the language in which the element's content is written. Programs reading this file might use that to properly index the content, correctly pronounce it via a screen reader, or even translate it into another language.</p><h3 id="secselfclosingelements">Self-Closing Elements</h3><p>A few HTML elements don't require a separate end-tag because they can't contain any child elements or other textural content. A great example is the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, which is used for inserting images into the page. You can specify the path to the image file in an attribute named <code>src</code>, but the image element itself can't contain additional text or other content. In these cases, all you need to include is the start tag:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>img</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>path/to/my/image.png<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">alt</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>descriptive text for screen readers and indexers<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><p>These are known as <strong>self-closing elements</strong>. You may also see these kinds of elements with a forward slash included before the ending greater-than sign. This was required by previous versions of HTML (especially the abomination known as <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_xhtml.asp">XHTML</a>), but in HTML5 it's totally optional. Some purists will still insist that you include it, and if you do, it looks like this:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>img</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>path/to/my/image.png<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">alt</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>descriptive text for screen readers and indexers<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">/></span></span></code></pre><p>But again, this is no longer required in HTML5, so feel free to omit that forward slash.</p><h3 id="seccomments">Comments</h3><p>Besides doctype declarations, elements, and attributes, the only other structural syntax in an HTML file is a comment, which looks like this:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">&lt;!-- this is a comment --></span></code></pre><p>Comments are ignored by the browser, so they can serve two purposes: documentation to help you or other developers understand some section of the page; or as a quick way to tell the browser to temporarily ignore a block of HTML that is causing you troubles.</p><p>Since the syntax is quite awkward to type, most web-optimized editors have a built-in keystroke that will toggle the current line as a comment. Try hitting <code>Cmd+/</code> (<code>Ctrl+/</code> on Windows). It should make the line a comment, and then make it not a comment the next time you use the same keystroke.</p><h2 id="secoveralldocumentstructure">Overall Document Structure</h2><p>Now that you understand the basic HTML syntax, let's see how they combine to create a basic page. As we noted earlier, every page begins with the HTML5 doctype declaration, and the rest is a tree of elements containing content. The root element is named <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and it should contain two child elements: <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Add this to your page:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span> <span class="token attr-name">lang</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>en<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>head</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>head</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><h3 id="sectheheadsection">The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> Section</h3><p>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element contains information about the page that doesn't appear in the main content window when viewing the page in the browser. For example, we can specify the title of the page here:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span> <span class="token attr-name">lang</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>en<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>head</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>title</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>My Web Page<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>title</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>head</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><p>Most browsers will show the page title in the tab at the top of the browser window, and use that as the default bookmark name if you bookmark the page. But search indexers and screen readers for the blind also use this to get the page title, which is often a strong signal about what the page body is about.</p><p>Note that I indented the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element so that it visibly looks like it's contained within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. This is good practice, and will help you read your page as the structure gets more complex. Since <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> can only contain <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> we don't typically indent those, but every other element should be indented one level farther than the element that contains it.</p><p>Another element you commonly see the in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section is <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>, which can be used to specify lots of different meta-data about the page. One very important bit of meta-data is the character set used when saving this file. The character set tells the browser how to translate the bits it receives from the server (or the local disk) into letters. Nearly all editors these days will save files in the UTF-8 character set, as it allows the mixing of different scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese, Arabic, etc) in the same file, while still optimizing the file's size. To tell the browser that this file was saved in UTF-8, add the following <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html</span> <span class="token attr-name">lang</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>en<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>html</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><p>You can also use the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element to specify other meta-data, such as the author, description, and keyword information about your document:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></span>

By default, a mobile browser will attempt to zoom out to show the entire page when it first loads. This is necessary if the page doesn't adjust its layout for smaller screens, but <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp">if your page is responsive to the screen width</a> (which ours will be), you can tell the browser not to zoom out using the <code>&lt;meta name="viewport"&gt;</code> element:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></span>

Double click on the HTML file in your Finder/File Explorer, and you should see the heading and the paragraph displayed in the browser window. The page title should also be shown in the browser tab.</p><p>Pretty simple, eh? That's really all you need to get going. You can use this page you just built as your default template for new pages, as it contains all the core elements every page should have.</p><h2 id="secthemostcommonelements">The Most Common Elements</h2><p>This next section will introduce you to the most commonly-used elements in web pages, but this is by no means exhaustive.</p><h3 id="secstructuralelements">Structural Elements</h3><p>HTML5 introduced several new elements that are meant to denote structural regions of the document: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/Tags/tag_header.asp">header</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/Tags/tag_main.asp">main</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/Tags/tag_article.asp">article</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/Tags/tag_section.asp">section</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/Tags/tag_aside.asp">aside</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/Tags/tag_footer.asp">footer</a>.</p><p>Although these are new, they still work fine with older browsers. HTML was defined to be forwards-compatible, so browsers treat unknown elements as simple block elements with no particular formatting. We will make use of these as we start to build more complex pages.</p><h3 id="secheadings">Headings</h3><p>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element from above is a top-level heading. There is typically only one of those in a page, and it should be used for the page's overall title. But HTML defines up to six levels of headings, and you can use those levels to define an outline of your document.</p><h3 id="secimages">Images</h3><p>As noted above, adding an image to your page is done using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>img</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>path/to/my/image.png<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">alt</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>descriptive text for screen readers and indexers<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><p>The <code>src</code> attribute should be an absolute or relative path to the image file. If the path begins with a protocol like <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>, the browser will treat that as a full URL and fetch it just as if you had typed it into the browser's address bar. If the path starts with <code>//</code>, it will add your page's current protocol (<code>http</code> or <code>https</code>) to the front and then fetch it. If the path begins with a single <code>/</code> character, it will request it from the same domain as the current page came from. And if it starts with any other character, it assumes the path is relative to the current page. So if the path was <code>img/some-image.png</code> it would look for a sub-folder named <code>img</code> and then look for a file named <code>some-image.png</code> within that sub-folder.</p><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The web was created by people who love Unix, so these are Unix-style paths, not Windows-style paths. Specifically, the names in these paths are <strong>case-sensitive</strong> and the separator between path parts must be a <code>/</code> character. On windows path names are case-insensitive and the separator is <code>\</code>, but on the web, it's the exact opposite!</p></blockquote><p>The <code>alt</code> attribute should contain some text that describes the image. This is primarily used by assistive technologies such as screen readers for the blind, but it is also used by indexers like Google to power their image search feature.</p><h3 id="seclists">Lists</h3><p>There are three kinds of lists in HTML: unordered, ordered, and dictionary lists. Unordered lists are for list of things that have no particular logical ordering, such as ingredients for a recipe:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>ul</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

This is obviously useful for encoding words and their meanings, but it can also be used for other name and definition pairs, such as dishes on a restaurant menu:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>dl</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

For example, a program might offer to sort an unordered list alphabetically, but should never sort an ordered list as it has an implicit ordering. Similarly, a program that prints a dictionary list would know that the term must always be on the same page as the definition.</p><h3 id="sechyperlinks">Hyperlinks</h3><p>The "H" in HTML standard for "Hypertext," which means that pages can link to each other. Encoding a link is done using the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>https://google.com<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>Search on Google<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><div class="screenshot"><a href="https://google.com">Search on Google</a></div><p>The <code>href</code> attribute should contain the URL for the page you want to navigate to. This can be absolute, as in the example above, or relative to the current page. For example, if I wanted to link to a page named <code>other-page.html</code> in the same directory as the current page, the <code>href</code> attribute would simply be <code>other-page.html</code>.</p><h4 id="secbookmarklinks">Bookmark Links</h4><p>Hyperlinks can also link to another section of the same document. We call these <strong>bookmark links</strong>. When activated, the browser scrolls the window so that the element the links points to is at the top of the browser window. They look like this:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>For more detail see the <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>#details<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>Details section<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span> later in this document.<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

...more content</code></pre><p>The <code>id</code> attribute can be added to any element, but the value must be unique within the page. That is, no two elements in the same page can have the same <code>id</code> value. Since these values are unique, you can create a hyperlink pointing to that element by adding a <code>#</code> in front of the <code>id</code> value. When activated, the browser finds that element and scroll the page to it. The browser will also append this <code>#details</code> to the end of the URL, allowing you to bookmark or share a link that goes directly to that section of the page.</p><h4 id="secmailandtellinks">Mail and Tel Links</h4><p>Instead of pointing to another page or another section of the same page, hyperlinks can also invoke other actions. For example, if you want a hyperlink to start a new email message to a particular email address when activated, just set the <code>href</code> attribute to <code>mailto:some-address@domain.com</code>. For example:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>For more information <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>mailto:informatics@uw.edu<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>contact us by email<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>.<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><div class="screenshot"><p>For more information <a href="mailto:informatics@uw.edu">contact us by email</a>.</p></div><p>You can also preset the subject line and carbon-copy addresses. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailto">mailto syntax reference</a> for more details.</p><p>A handy variant for mobile phones is the <code>tel:some-phone-number</code> syntax. When activated, these links ask users if they want to dial the number after the <code>tel:</code>. Here's a quick example:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>For more information <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>tel:+12065551212<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>give us a call!<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>.<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span></code></pre><div class="screenshot"><p>For more information <a href="tel:+12065551212">give us a call!</a>.</p></div><p>On tablets and desktop browsers, these links may offer to launch various audio/video chat applications, such as Facetime or Skype.</p><p>Note that it's always a good idea to include the country code in <code>tel:</code> links, as people from other countries may want to click the link to dial. The country code for the USA and Canada is <code>1</code>, and country codes are prefixed by a <code>+</code>, so the number above starts with <code>+1...</code></p><h3 id="secdivandspan"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code></h3><p>The last elements to mention are <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>. These elements stand for "division" and "span" respectively. They don't connote any particular meaning, but they are used whenever you need to group some content for other purposes. For example, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is used often to group a set of elements that you want to style in some particular way (e.g., common background color). And <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is used for a run of text within a paragraph that you want to style differently than the text surrounding it.</p><p>You will see <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> used quite a bit as we get into building more complex HTML pages.</p><h2 id="secsummary">Summary</h2><p>That's all there is to it.
